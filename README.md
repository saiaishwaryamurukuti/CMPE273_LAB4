For Part-1:

The DistributedCacheService class has been changed to support CRDT. When this class is instantiated, user now needs to specify how many nodes are there in the service. After this, any "put" operation by client will put the data to all nodes and "get" will verify if any repair operation is needed.

Support for DELETE can be found in:

  1. server/src/main/java/edu/sjsu/cmpe/cache/repository/InMemoryCache.java
  2. server/src/main/java/edu/sjsu/cmpe/cache/repository/CacheInterface.java
  3. server/src/main/java/edu/sjsu/cmpe/cache/api/resources/CacheResource.java
Rollback on WRITE implementation is found in:

  1. client/src/main/java/edu/sjsu/cmpe/cache/client/DistributedCacheService.java
For Part-2: Repair on read is implemented inside the DistributedCacheService class itself. No new client class is added to support this.
